In Roman times, numbers were represented using letters. The way of doing this, known as Roman
Numerals, is often seen depicting the copyright date on films and television.
Roman numerals are conventionally defined to represent numbers using seven letters: I=1, V=5,
X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500 and M=1000. Numbers other than these are formed by placing letters
together from left to right, in descending order of size, and adding their values. The basic rule is to
always use the biggest numeral possible (e.g. 15 is represented as XV, but never as VVV, VX or XIIIII).
Letters may not appear more than three times in a row, so there are six exceptions to these rules â€“ the
combinations IV, IX, XL, XC, CD and CM. In these cases a letter is placed before one of greater value,
and the smaller value is subtracted from the larger, e.g. CD = 400.
